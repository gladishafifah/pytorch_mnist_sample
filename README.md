# 🚀 PyTorch MNIST Sample: Hyperparameter Testing 🎉

Welcome to the PyTorch MNIST Sample project! Here, we’ll be experimenting with hyperparameters to train a CNN on the MNIST dataset and achieve an accuracy greater than 90%! Follow these steps to complete the task:

## 📋 Project Overview
In this project, we’re using PyTorch to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Let's get started by forking, cloning, and running some code!

## 🛠️ Steps to Complete

1. **Fork and Clone the Repo** 🍴  
   - Fork [this repository](https://github.com/Rietaros/pytorch_mnist_sample).
   - Clone it to your local machine using the following command:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pytorch_mnist_sample.git
     ```
   
2. **Run the Notebook** 📓  
   - Open **pytorch-mnist.ipynb** in Google Colab.
   - Run the code as-is to check the initial accuracy result.

3. **Create a New Branch** 🌿  
   - Create a branch named `parameter-testing` to track your modifications:  
     ```bash
     git checkout -b parameter-testing
     ```

4. **Modify Hyperparameters** 🔧  
   - In **pytorch-mnist.ipynb**, adjust the `learning_rate` and `momentum` parameters to improve the CNN model's accuracy.
   - Aim for an accuracy of **over 90%** 🎯!

5. **Commit Your Changes** 💾  
   - Add and commit the changes in the `parameter-testing` branch:  
     ```bash
     git add pytorch-mnist.ipynb
     git commit -m "Modify Hyperparameter Changes"
     ```

6. **Push Your Changes** 🚀  
   - Push the `parameter-testing` branch to your GitHub repository:  
     ```bash
     git push origin parameter-testing
     ```

7. **Create a Pull Request** 🔄  
   - Navigate to your fork on GitHub.
   - Create a **Pull Request** from your `parameter-testing` branch to the original repository: [Rietaros/pytorch_mnist_sample](https://github.com/Rietaros/pytorch_mnist_sample).
   - Include a descriptive title and message for your pull request.
